# LEO Website Template

## Why this project?

Nearly a third of counties in the US have no web presence whatsoever and many others have outdated websites. 

We worked with researchers and real live Election Officials to design a user friendly website template. The goal was a completely free platform that someone with limited tech skills could maintain. After comparing some options, we chose Google Blogger.
